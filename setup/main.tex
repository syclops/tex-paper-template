% This is the setup file. It contains usepackage commands, acronyms, and other
% useful commands needed to set up the paper. Uncomment the relevant sections to
% use them.

% Some commands rely on a conditional to have different behavior at submit time
% (e.g., any author comments are stripped from submission versions of the final
% paper). Uncomment \submittrue below to use submit-time behavior, and
% \submitfalse to use default behavior. If both lines are uncommented, whatever
% comes later will take precedence.
\newif\ifsubmit{}  % Flag for distinguishing submission commands
%\submittrue{}
\submitfalse{}
