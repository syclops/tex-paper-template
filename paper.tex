% Any commands that need to be run before the \documentclass command below
% should be done in the preclass file below.
\input{setup/preclass}

% This should match the documentclass specified in your style template.
\documentclass{article}

% Do any other setup of packages, commands, in the relevant setup file, imported
% with the following file.
\input{setup/main}

\begin{document}

% Place title information here. Depending on the specific style template you may
% need a different command for the title.
\title{}

% Place author information here. Depending on the specific style template, you
% may need a different command for the author(s).
\author{}

% This is where the title, authors, etc. are actually placed. The location of
% this command, or the command itself, may vary depending on the template.
\maketitle

% Place all needed sections, including the abstract, here. In some cases, other
% commands may need to be placed in between sections (e.g., some styles place
% keywords between the abstract and main paper body). There's almost always an
% abstract, intro, and conclusion, so place those here.

%\input{sec/abstract}

%\input{sec/intro}

%\input{sec/conclusion}

% Specify the bibliography style and file here. The style will depend on which
% template you use, but the file (bib.bib in this case) can be left as is,
% unless you rename that file.
\bibliographystyle{abbrv}
\bibliography{bib}

% Some templates put appendices after the bibliography. If so, feel free to add
% them here. Make sure that the relevant files (e.g., app/foo.tex) exist.
%\appendix
%\input{app/foo}

\end{document}

% Anything here or later will be ignored in the final document, so feel free to
% put notes/etc here.
